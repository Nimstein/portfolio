  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/PerformancePulseTracker/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Tableau - Performance Pulse Tracker</a><br>
  A simple dashboard for tracking the performance of marketing efforts across several platforms.<br>
  It features dynamic date aggregation, allowing the user to choose between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly aggregation, as well as filter by platforms and devices.<br>
  Users can explore acquisition costs across marketing channels, compare first-time and repeat purchase trends, and have the freedom to explore each date point with a performance table that shows key metrics.
  The data is sourced from the Google Merchandise Store analytics dataset, a curated subset of anonymized Google Analytics event data made available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/google-merchandise-sales-data">Kaggle</a>.
  The dataset was cleaned and extended with synthetic data in Python to cover a longer time range, then further modeled into a daily blended table and loaded to tableau for further row based modeling.

  A simple dashboard for tracking the performance of marketing efforts across several platforms.<br>
  It features dynamic date aggregation, allowing the user to choose between Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly aggregation, as well as filter by platforms and devices.<br>
  Users can explore acquisition costs across marketing channels, compare first-time and repeat purchase trends, and have the freedom to explore each date point with a performance table that shows key metrics.
  The data is sourced from the Google Merchandise Store analytics dataset, a curated subset of anonymized Google Analytics event data made available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/google-merchandise-sales-data">Kaggle</a>.

  In this project we produce a report to the marketing department regarding the performance of various traffic sources which direct users to use the e-commerce services the company offers.<br>
  We will examine the different costs and benefits of running these sources and through various methods of analysis we determine which ones work towards the long term benefit of the company, and which ones hurt it.<br><br>

  In this Kaggle competition, we are tasked with creating a machine learning model which accepts tweet text and predicts whether the tweet describes a real disaster or if it is innocently referencing disaster related keywords. We employ the SpaCy NLP module to tokenize the tweets and use a word vectorizer to generate features for our model. We also engineer many features such as word count, average word length and more!<br>
  We employ feature engineering and cross validation parameter optimization accross various machine learning models to fill in missing values and predict which passengers survived and which did not.<br><br>

  In this project we perform an evaluation on two AB tests that were done under less than optimal conditions.<br>
  As such, in order to make sense of them, we employ rigorous EDA to determine if the tests are viable, and CR funnel analysis combined with statistical testing to determine if the results are meaningful.
