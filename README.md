<h1>My Student Projects</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository is a collection of analysis projects of various subjects in data analysis.<br>
Subjects Include but are not limited to:<br>
EDA, Statistical DA, Business Analytics, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning, Data Visualization, SQL and Automation.
<br><br>
Each link directs to the jupyter notebook of the project.<br>
I've also included a download link for each project including its dependencies for running the project locally.

  In this project we perform a product range analysis on an online store invoice dataset.<br>
  We use several data analysis methods such as Machine learning (Association rules), Seasonality analysis, First transaction analysis and hypothesis testing.<br><br>

  In this project we employ machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of churn for customers of a gym.<br>
  We will use both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, determine the best algorithm based on each algorithm's metrics and analyze the importance of each data feature to the chance of customer churn.<br><br>

  In this project we perform a cohort analysis on a ticket selling business data and calculate various business metrics such as LTV, CAC, ROI, and ROMI.<br>
  This will help us determine the success of the business as well as investigate which marketing campaign is producing the best return on investment and which ones we should immediately drop.<br><br>

  In this project we analyze the results of an A/A/B test of a company that wanted to test a new font on their website.<br>
  We evaluate the results of the test and the reliability of the test conditions using CR funnel analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.<br><br>

  In this project we are asked to analyze the results of an A/B test in order to produce business recommendations.<br>
  We prioritize several hypotheses and test them against the results of the AB test, and combined with our explorative analysis we recommend a preferred course of action.<br><br>
