  In this Kaggle competition, we are tasked with creating a machine learning model which accepts tweet text and predicts whether the tweet describes a real disaster or if it is innocently referencing disaster related keywords. We employ the SpaCy NLP module to tokenize the tweets and use a word vectorizer to generate features for our model. We also engineer many features such as word count, average word length and more!<br>
  We employ feature engineering and cross validation parameter optimization accross various machine learning models to fill in missing values and predict which passengers survived and which did not.<br><br>

  In this Kaggle competition, we are given a train and test dataset with information about passengers of the RMS Titanic that were on board while the superliner sank.<br>
  We employ feature engineering and cross validation parameter optimization accross various machine learning models to fill in missing values and predict which passengers survived and which did not.<br><br>

  In this project we perform an evaluation on two AB tests that were done under less than optimal conditions.<br>
  As such, in order to make sense of them, we employ rigorous EDA to determine if the tests are viable, and CR funnel analysis combined with statistical testing to determine if the results are meaningful.

  In this project we are asked to analyze the results of an A/B test in order to produce business recommendations.<br>
  We prioritize several hypotheses and test them against the results of the AB test, and combined with our explorative analysis we recommend a preferred course of action.<br><br>

  In this project we take a look at the trending section of youtube, to determine the profile of videos that tend to receive the Trending tag in various sections of the globe.<br>
  We use Tableau to visualize our findings and make our case.<br>
  With the help of our conclusions we will be able to recommend the type of videos that have the most ad revenue potential for our marketing team!<br><br>
