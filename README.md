<h1>My_Projects</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository is a collection of analysis projects of various subjects in data analysis.<br>
Subjects Include but are not limited to:<br>
EDA, Statistical DA, Business Analytics, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning, Data Visualization, SQL and Automation.

Each link directs to the jupyter notebook of the project.<br>
I've also included a download link for each project including its dependencies for running the project locally.
<h2>Projects</h2>
  <a href="/project_notebooks/1-e_commerce_product_range_analysis/1-e_commerce_product_range_analysis.ipynb">Product Range Analysis</a> | <a href="/project_notebooks/1-e_commerce_product_range_analysis/1-e_commerce_product_range_analysis.zip?raw=True">Download Project</a><br>
  In this project we perform a product range analysis on an online store invoice dataset.<br>
  We use several data analysis methods such as Machine learning (Association rules), Seasonality analysis, First transaction analysis and hypothesis testing.<br>
  <a href= "/project_notebooks/2-gym_churn_analysis_machine_learning/2-gym_churn_analysis_machine_learning.ipynb">Churn Prediction Machine Learning Analysis</a> | <a href="/project_notebooks/2-gym_churn_analysis_machine_learning/2-gym_churn_analysis_machine_learning.zip?raw=True">Download Project</a><br>
  In this project we employ machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of churn for customers of a gym.<br>
  We will use both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, determine the best algorithm based on each algorithm's metrics and analyze the importance of each data feature to the chance of customer churn.<br>
  <a href= "/project_notebooks/3-business_analytics/3-business_analytics.ipynb">Business Analytics</a> | <a href="/project_notebooks/3-business_analytics/3-business_analytics.zip?raw=True">Download Project</a><br>
  In this project we perform a cohort analysis on a ticket selling business data and calculate various business metrics such as LTV, CAC, ROI, and ROMI.<br>
  This will help us determine the success of the business as well as investigate which marketing campaign is producing the best return on investment and which ones we should immediately drop.
